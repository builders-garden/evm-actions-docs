# ⚡️ EVM Actions open source repositories
Using the starter above we also built several EVM Actions:

- [Action trade](https://github.com/builders-garden/evm-actions-trade): execute swaps using 1inch API on Base
- [Action crowdfunding](https://github.com/builders-garden/evm-actions-crowdfunding): donate to a campaign using $NOUNS on Base and be recognized through an NFT
- [Action sign-in with Dynamic](https://github.com/builders-garden/evm-actions-dynamic-login): sign-in in the browser and be redirected to a Dyanamic-compatible app already signed-in
- [Action sign-in with Privy](https://github.com/builders-garden/evm-actions-privy-login): sign-in in the browser and be redirected to a Privy-compatible app already signed-in
