# ⚡️ What are EVM Actions?

EVM Actions are APIs that return actions - such as signing of messages or transactions - directly to a user. They are hosted at publicly accessible URLs and are therefore accessible by their URL for any client to interact with.

Right now, 4 types of actions are supported:

- **Transaction**: prompt the user to execute a transactions through an EOA
  - Transfer 0.01 ETH to limone.eth
  - Mint an NFT on Base
- **Signatures:** prompt the user to sign a transaction through an EOA
  - Sign a Safe transaction
- **Links:** redirect the user to an external website
- **1-click Login:** allow the user to quickly login into an external application with their connected EOA
  - 1-click login into a webapp supporting Dynamic / Privy / Wallet Connect as auth or wallet providers
